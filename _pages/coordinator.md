Islesboro’s Community Energy Coordinator will work to understand community members’ needs and barriers to making home energy upgrades. We will also plan how to connect Islesboro organizations and residents to guidance, home assessments, funding, and collective upgrades/purchases.

            <i class="fa-solid fa-quote-left"></i> I moved to the island twelve years ago from London. Since joining the community I’ve worked for the Islesboro Island News newspaper and the Island Market. In the pursuit of my passion for public service, I embraced the role of an Emergency Medical Technician. I’ve also been Chair of the Recreation Committee and run the Islesboro Facebook page, so I’ve varied connections to the community.<br /><br />
            I am driven by a genuine love for Islesboro and a vision for a brighter, more sustainable future.
