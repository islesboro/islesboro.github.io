## Join us at the Jamboree!

Are you interested in safer, more comfortable, healthier, and cheaper home heating and appliances? More reliable and independent electricity sources for the island? Have you ever taken a ride in an electric vehicle?
The Islesboro Energy Committee welcomes all community members to drop by the Energy Jamboree, have lunch and treats that will support Islesboro organizations, and tell us about your home energy use for a chance to win electric tools and gadgets. Come for the performances and stories from our fellow islanders, and stay to talk to the businesses that are helping us make the switch to better home heating, clean electricity, electric cars and bikes, insulation, and weatherization.

The event will feature:
- Electric car and E-bike test rides
- Information on home energy savings and weatherization opportunities
- Experts on heating equipment, insulation, heat pumps, solar and more
- ICS student sustainability showcase
- Community member presentations
- Kids zone activities
- Local food vendors
- Outdoor music performances
- Door prizes

The Energy Jamboree is also the first public event that will provide input for the Energy Transitions Partnership initiative (ETIPP), in which the town has partnered with the National Labs to find ways to support lower energy costs, warmer homes, cleaner fuels, and a reliable and independent electrical grid.

We want to hear about the challenges you and your family have faced with all things energy-related: Have you thought about what you’ll do when it’s time to replace your furnace, water heater, stove, or car? We welcome your ideas for what you would like to see and get from the event via our survey:
