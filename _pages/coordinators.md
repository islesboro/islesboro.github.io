Islesboro’s Community Energy Coordinators will work to understand community members’ needs and barriers to making home energy upgrades. 

We will also plan how to connect Islesboro organizations and residents to guidance, home assessments, funding, and collective upgrades/purchases.

        I have many family ties to Islesboro and have long dreamed of moving here. I am excited to be a part of a group dedicated to improving energy efficiency and Islesboro’s resiliency. Please say hello if you see me at the Sewing Circle, Town Office, and other community events.
